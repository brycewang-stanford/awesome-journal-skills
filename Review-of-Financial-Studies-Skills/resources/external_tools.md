| BIS / IMF / World Bank | Official | Cross-country banking, capital flows |

### Frontier / specialized (fintech, climate, household)
| Source | Typical use |
|--------|-------------|
| Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) | Household balance sheets |
| HMDA mortgage data | Mortgage lending, household finance |
| Crypto exchange / on-chain data (e.g., CoinGecko, blockchain explorers) | Digital assets, microstructure |
| Carbon emissions / ESG vendors (e.g., Trucost, MSCI, Sustainalytics) | Climate & sustainable finance |
| Regulatory filings (EDGAR / SEC) | Text analysis, disclosure, events |

> Always document point-in-time linking, delisting returns, survivorship, and look-ahead bias
> handling in the Internet Appendix.

## 2. Statistical software

### Stata
- Panel / FE: `reghdfe`, `xtreg`
- Modern DID: `csdid` (Callaway–Sant'Anna), `did_multiplegt`, `eventstudyinteract` (Sun–Abraham), `bacondecomp`
- IV: `ivreg2`, `ivreghdfe`, weak-IV: `weakivtest`
- RDD: `rdrobust`, `rddensity`
- Asset pricing: `asreg` (rolling/Fama–MacBeth), `xtfmb`, Newey–West / Driscoll–Kraay options
- Matching: `psmatch2`, `teffects`

### Python
- `pandas`, `numpy` — data wrangling
- `statsmodels`, `linearmodels` (PanelOLS, FamaMacBeth, IV2SLS)
- `wrds` — WRDS data API
- `scikit-learn` — ML / double-ML pipelines
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — figures

### R
- `data.table`, `dplyr` — data wrangling
- `fixest` (high-dimensional FE, IV, event study), `did`, `plm`
- `rdrobust`, `rddensity`
- `sandwich`, `lmtest` — robust / clustered SEs
- `frenchdata` — Ken French factor data

### MATLAB / Julia
- Structural estimation, DSGE, dynamic models, GMM/SMM

## 3. Identification & robustness helpers
- Multiple-testing: FDR/Holm/Bonferroni utilities; t-hurdle discussion per the asset-pricing replication literature (e.g., Harvey–Liu–Zhu)
- Synthetic control: `synth`, `synthdid`
- Bootstrap / randomization-inference routines for placebo tests

## 4. Writing, typesetting, reproducibility
- LaTeX (TeX Live / MacTeX; Overleaf for collaboration); `booktabs` for tables; `estout`/`esttab`, `outreg2`, `stargazer` for regression tables
- Reference management: Zotero, EndNote, BibTeX
- Reproducibility: Git + GitHub/GitLab; project structure with raw/derived data separation; a master script that reproduces every exhibit
- Internet Appendix and replication package prepared for RFS's **public code-release condition** (RFS requires public release of all code underlying a published paper, as a condition of publication; an exception must be requested in the cover letter)

## 6. Notes
1. **Licensing**: respect provider terms; do not redistribute raw vendor data.
2. **Point-in-time discipline**: avoid look-ahead bias in fundamentals and factor construction.
3. **Reproducibility**: keep code and data versions that regenerate every table/figure.
4. **Data policy**: RFS data/code requirements evolve — confirm the current policy before submission.
