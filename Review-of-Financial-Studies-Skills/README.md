Agent skill stack for manuscripts targeted at **The Review of Financial Studies (RFS)** — published by Oxford University Press for the Society for Financial Studies (SFS), and one of the "top-3" finance journals alongside the *Journal of Finance* and the *Journal of Financial Economics*.

This repository is opinionated. It is **not** a generic finance-writing toolbox. It is an **RFS-specific** stack built around the journal's governing tension — **novelty AND rigor** — covering novel-question topic selection, literature positioning, causal and asset-pricing identification, empirical/structural design, robustness and multiple-testing discipline, publication-grade exhibits, the journal-hosted Internet Appendix, house style, SFS Editorial Express submission, referee strategy, and multi-round rebuttals.

## Why a Separate RFS Skill Stack?

RFS shares JF/JFE's high causal-inference bar but adds constraints of its own:

| Constraint                | The Review of Financial Studies                                  | Implication                                                  |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Discipline                | Finance (asset pricing, corporate, household, fintech, climate)   | Pure non-finance or undertheorized papers are off-fit        |
| Core test                 | **Novelty AND rigor** — both, simultaneously                      | A clean but "me-too" paper is a weak fit; so is novelty alone |
| Receptivity to new work   | Notably open to new questions, data, methods, and theory+empirics | Genuinely new framings are rewarded, not penalized           |
| Identification            | Same causal-inference bar as JF/JFE (natural experiments, IV, RDD, modern DID) | OLS + controls on a causal claim is a desk-reject risk |
| Asset pricing             | Correct/clustered SEs, OOS tests, multiple-testing discipline     | A new predictor without data-mining defense is rejected      |
| Theory + empirics         | Welcomed and expected to be integrated                            | A model and an unrelated regression read as two papers       |
| Internet Appendix         | Journal-hosted; refereed alongside the paper                      | Robustness/proofs/data detail belong there, cross-referenced |
| Process                   | SFS Editorial Express (editorialexpress.com); fee + SFS norms; multi-round | Demanding revision; verify current fee/policy on the RFS site |

Generic "scientific writing" or "finance writing" packs do not address these constraints.

## Quick Start

### Option A — Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/rfs-skills
/plugin install rfs-skills
/reload-plugins
```

### Option B — Manual Copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/rfs-skills.git
cd rfs-skills

mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -R skills/rfs-* ~/.claude/skills/
# or
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills && cp -R skills/rfs-* ~/.codex/skills/
```

### First Prompt

```
Use rfs-workflow to tell me which skill I should use next for my RFS manuscript.
```

---

## Default Workflow

```text
rfs-topic-selection
        ▼
rfs-literature-positioning
        ▼
rfs-identification
        ▼
rfs-empirical-design
        ▼
rfs-robustness
        ▼
rfs-tables-figures
        ▼
rfs-internet-appendix
        ▼
rfs-writing-style       (polish)
        ▼
rfs-submission
        ▼
rfs-referee-strategy
        ▼
rfs-rebuttal
```

`rfs-workflow` is the router — it tells you which skill to use next based on where you are.

## Differences vs. JF / JFE Skills

| Dimension            | Review of Financial Studies          | Journal of Finance / JFE                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Identification bar   | Top-3 causal-inference standard      | Top-3 causal-inference standard           |
| Novelty receptivity  | **Especially open** to new questions/data/methods | Open, but RFS most explicitly rewards it |
| Theory + empirics    | Integrated structural/theory welcomed | Welcomed (JFE), strong at JF too         |
| House quirk          | Journal-hosted Internet Appendix is central | Similar; details differ per journal |
| Distinctive risk     | "Rigorous but not novel" me-too paper | Same family of risks                      |

These three journals overlap heavily; this stack is tuned to the RFS lever — novelty made credible.
