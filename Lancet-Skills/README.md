Agent skill stack for manuscripts targeted at **The Lancet** — the flagship clinical-medicine and global-health journal.

This pack is opinionated. It is **not** a generic "medical writing" toolbox. It is a **Lancet-specific** stack that encodes the journal's editorial bar — **clinically and public-health important, globally relevant, and likely to change practice or policy, often with an equity lens** — and the concrete conventions that follow from it: prospective trial registration, protocol + statistical analysis plan, EQUATOR reporting guidelines with the mandatory study-flow diagram, the signature **Research in context** panel, the structured abstract with **Findings / Interpretation / Funding** headings, clinical statistics, the **Declaration of interests** and **role of the funding source** statements, the data sharing statement, and SAGER sex/gender plus equity reporting.

## Why a Separate Lancet Stack?

The Lancet imposes constraints that differ materially from a basic-science journal — and from NEJM, JAMA, and BMJ:

| Constraint                | The Lancet                                                       | Implication                                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Editorial bar             | Clinically/public-health important, **globally relevant**, practice/policy-changing, equity-aware | Most papers are **rejected without review** if narrow or local |
| Trial registration        | **Prospective** registration (before enrollment) is mandatory; number in the abstract | A retrospectively registered trial may be ineligible          |
| Reporting guideline        | CONSORT / STROBE / PRISMA via EQUATOR, with the **flow diagram**  | An RCT without a CONSORT flow diagram is not submission-ready  |
| Research in context        | A **required three-part panel** with a documented systematic search | A search-free panel signals an unsystematic review            |
| Abstract                  | Structured, ≤ ~300 words, **Background / Methods / Findings / Interpretation / Funding** | "Results / Conclusions" headings are off-style                |
| Disclosures               | **Declaration of interests** + **role of the funding source** + data sharing statement | Missing funder-role / data-sharing statements block submission |
| Equity reporting          | **SAGER** sex/gender + race/ethnicity + PROGRESS-Plus where relevant | Sex-blind reporting is a flagged omission                     |
| Over-claiming             | Cautious language; no causal claim beyond the design             | Conclusions must not outrun the evidence                      |

Generic "medical writing" packs do not encode these venue constraints — and a basic-science framing (broad significance, supplement-first methods) is the wrong model here.

## Quick Start

### Option A — Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/awesome-journal-skills
/plugin install lancet-skills
/reload-plugins
```

### Option B — Manual Copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/awesome-journal-skills.git
cd awesome-journal-skills/Lancet-Skills

mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -R skills/lancet-* ~/.claude/skills/
# or
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills && cp -R skills/lancet-* ~/.codex/skills/
```

### First Prompt

```
Use lancet-workflow to tell me which skill I should use next for my manuscript targeted at The Lancet.
```

---

## Default Workflow

```text
lancet-fit                 (clear the importance / global-relevance / policy bar first)
        ▼
lancet-study-design        (registration + protocol + SAP + design rigor)
        ▼
lancet-reporting           (CONSORT / STROBE / PRISMA + flow diagram)
        ▼
lancet-statistics          (pre-specified analysis, ITT, CIs, subgroups)
        ▼
lancet-figures-tables      (Table 1, Kaplan–Meier, forest, study-flow diagram)
        ▼
lancet-research-in-context (the signature three-part panel + systematic search)
        ▼
lancet-abstract            (structured abstract: Findings / Interpretation / Funding ≤300w)
        ▼
lancet-writing             (IMRaD structure; cautious Discussion; ~3000–3500w)
        ▼
lancet-ethics              (declaration of interests, role of funding, data sharing, SAGER)
        ▼
lancet-submission          (preflight + cover letter)
        ▼
lancet-rebuttal            (after review — incl. the statistical reviewer)
```

`lancet-workflow` is the router — it tells you which skill to use next based on where you are.

## Differences vs. NEJM / JAMA / BMJ

| Dimension          | The Lancet                                  | NEJM                          | JAMA                          | BMJ                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Emphasis           | Global health, equity, public health, policy | Clinically definitive, US-centric | Clinical + health policy    | Generalist EBM, patient partnership |
| Signature artifact | **Research in context** panel (systematic search) | None equivalent            | Structured abstract           | "What this paper adds" box    |
| Abstract headings  | Findings / Interpretation (not Results / Conclusions) | Conclusions               | Conclusions                   | Conclusions                   |
| Voice              | International, explicit advocacy             | Conservative                  | Methodological                | Open-access, EBM-forward      |
| When to switch     | —                                           | Definitive RCT, no equity angle | Strong stats/policy fit     | Strong patient-partnership angle |

For Science, see [Science-Skills](https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/awesome-journal-skills/tree/main/Science-Skills). Within the Lancet family, consider *Lancet Global Health*, *Lancet Public Health*, a specialty title, or *EClinicalMedicine* via `lancet-fit`.
