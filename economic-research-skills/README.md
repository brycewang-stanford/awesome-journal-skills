Agent skill stack for manuscripts targeted at **《经济研究》 (Economic Research Journal)** — the top economics journal in China, designated by the State Council Academic Degrees Committee.

This repository is opinionated. It is **not** a generic Chinese-economics writing toolbox. It is an **Economic-Research-specific** stack covering topic selection with theoretical grounding, bilingual literature review, modern quasi-experimental identification, mechanism / heterogeneity analysis, CSSCI house style, policy implications, and R&R rebuttals.

## Why a Separate Economic-Research Skill Stack?

《经济研究》 imposes constraints that differ materially from AER / AEJ / top finance journals:

| Constraint                | Economic Research                                          | Implication                                                |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Discipline                | Economics (macro / institutional / econometric / industry) | Pure-management or pure-case papers are off-fit            |
| Topic                     | Theoretical contribution + China problem                   | "Policy evaluation only" reads as a working paper          |
| Contribution sentences    | 3–5 explicit "边际贡献" bullets in intro                    | Cannot be a single paragraph                               |
| Literature review         | Bilingual; **canonical theory citations required**         | Missing canonical theory refs is a desk-reject signal      |
| Identification            | Quasi-experimental + careful endogeneity discussion        | OLS + controls often desk-rejected                         |
| Mechanism                 | Near-mandatory                                             | Empirical papers without mechanism rarely accepted         |
| Heterogeneity             | Strongly preferred                                         | Often requested in R&R if missing                          |
| Policy implications       | Mandatory; framed as "significance" rather than "actions"  | Different from 《管理世界》 actionable-policy style         |
| Length                    | ~15–25k Chinese characters incl. exhibits                  | Substantially longer than AER; full structure expected     |
| Abstract                  | 200–400 Chinese characters                                 | "What we do + what we find" first, then significance       |

Generic "scientific writing" or "economics writing" skill packs do not address these constraints.

## Quick Start

### Option A — Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/economic-research-skills
/plugin install economic-research-skills
/reload-plugins
```

### Option B — Manual Copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/economic-research-skills.git
cd economic-research-skills

mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -R skills/er-* ~/.claude/skills/
# or
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills && cp -R skills/er-* ~/.codex/skills/
```

### First Prompt

```
Use er-workflow to tell me which skill I should use next for my Economic-Research manuscript.
```

---

## Default Workflow

```text
er-topic-selection
        ▼
er-literature-review
        ▼
er-identification
        ▼
er-mechanism
        ▼
er-heterogeneity
        ▼
er-tables-figures
        ▼
er-policy-implication
        ▼
er-abstract      (polish)
        ▼
er-style         (polish)
        ▼
er-submission
        ▼
er-rebuttal
```

`er-workflow` is the router — it tells you which skill to use next based on where you are.

## Differences vs. Management-World Skills

| Dimension          | Economic Research               | Management World                   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Discipline         | Economics (macro / institutional) | Management + applied economics  |
| Policy framing     | Significance (macro / qualitative) | Actionable (ministry-level)    |
| Case / qualitative | Rarely accepted                 | Accepted                           |
| Theory citations   | **Required**                    | Optional                           |
| Writing style      | Theoretical rigor               | Practical relevance                |
