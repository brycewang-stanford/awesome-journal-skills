Agent skill stack for manuscripts targeted at **《中国行政管理》 (Chinese Public Administration)** — a leading CSSCI journal sponsored by the Chinese Public Administration Society and one of the most authoritative outlets in China's public administration and governance field.

This repository is opinionated. It is **not** a generic Chinese social-science writing toolbox. It is a **Chinese-Public-Administration-specific** stack covering governance-theory topic selection, bilingual literature review, mixed quantitative-qualitative research design and causal inference, governance / policy-process mechanism analysis, cross-context heterogeneity, CSSCI house style, grounded-yet-actionable policy implications, and review-response rebuttals.

## Why a Separate Chinese-Public-Administration Skill Stack?

《中国行政管理》 imposes constraints that differ materially from economics journals (such as 《经济研究》) and from international PA journals (JPART / PAR / Governance):

| Constraint                | Chinese Public Administration                                       | Implication                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Discipline                | Public administration / governance / public policy                 | Pure-economics or pure-management papers are off-fit         |
| Theory anchor             | A PA theory frame is required (governance, NPM / NPS, policy-process) | "Data + regression only" reads as off-discipline           |
| Method pluralism          | Quantitative **and** qualitative both first-class                  | Normative, case, comparative, and empirical designs all OK   |
| Research-question fit     | Method must match the question, not the fashion                    | A quasi-experiment grafted onto a governance question fails  |
| China governance reality  | Topic must be anchored in real Chinese governance practice         | Abstract "global" framing without China context reads thin   |
| Mechanism                 | Governance / policy-process mechanism expected                     | "Effect without process" is weak for a PA reviewer           |
| Policy implications       | More actionable than economics journals, but must rest on analysis | The "强化/完善/健全/推进" four-verb filler is a reject signal |
| Length & exhibits         | Full-structure Chinese article; figures / tables as needed         | Working-paper-style fragments are off-fit                    |
| Abstract                  | Concise Chinese abstract; question → method → finding → significance | Empty-significance opening reads as filler                   |

Generic "social-science writing" or "economics writing" skill packs do not address these constraints.

## Quick Start

### Option A — Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/chinese-public-administration-skills
/plugin install chinese-public-administration-skills
/reload-plugins
```

### Option B — Manual Copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/chinese-public-administration-skills.git
cd chinese-public-administration-skills

mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -R skills/cpa-* ~/.claude/skills/
# or
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills && cp -R skills/cpa-* ~/.codex/skills/
```

### First Prompt

```
Use cpa-workflow to tell me which skill I should use next for my Chinese-Public-Administration manuscript.
```

---

## Default Workflow

```text
cpa-topic-selection
        ▼
cpa-literature-review
        ▼
cpa-identification     (research design: quant / qual / normative)
        ▼
cpa-mechanism
        ▼
cpa-heterogeneity
        ▼
cpa-tables-figures
        ▼
cpa-policy-implication
        ▼
cpa-abstract      (polish)
        ▼
cpa-style         (polish)
        ▼
cpa-submission
        ▼
cpa-rebuttal
```

`cpa-workflow` is the router — it tells you which skill to use next based on where you are.

## Skills

| Skill                     | Purpose                                                          |

| `cpa-literature-review`   | Bilingual PA-theory + China-governance literature structure      |
| `cpa-identification`      | Research design: quant (survey / admin data / DID-IV-RDD) + qual (case / process-tracing / grounded theory) + normative |
| `cpa-mechanism`           | Governance / policy-process mechanism (implementation, attention, central-local, incentives) |

## Differences vs. Economic-Research Skills

| Dimension          | Chinese Public Administration         | Economic Research                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Discipline         | Public administration / governance    | Economics (macro / institutional)  |
| Method             | Mixed quant + qual, normative welcome | Quantitative causal inference      |
| Theory anchor      | Governance / NPM-NPS / policy process | Economic theory                    |
| Policy framing     | Actionable for government practice, grounded | Significance / institutional |
| Case / qualitative | First-class                           | Rarely accepted                    |
