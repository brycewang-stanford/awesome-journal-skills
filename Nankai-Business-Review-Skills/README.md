Agent skill stack for manuscripts targeted at **《南开管理评论》 (Nankai Business Review, NBR)** — the top Chinese business-school journal, sponsored by Nankai University (Business School) and supervised by the Ministry of Education (founded 1998 from the earlier 《国际经贸研究》; ISSN 1008-3448; CN 12-1288/F).

This repository is opinionated. It is **not** a generic management-writing toolbox, and it is **not** an econometric-identification stack. It is an **NBR-specific** stack built around the journal's defining bar: **theory contribution + China context + measurement rigor**, delivered through survey-SEM, experiments, or multi-case / grounded-theory methods.

Verified journal facts live in [`resources/journal-profile.md`](resources/journal-profile.md) with source links.

## Why a Separate Stack?

NBR imposes constraints that differ from economics / macro-policy journals (经济研究 / 管理世界 / 中国工业经济) and from math-modeling journals (管理科学学报):

| Constraint | Nankai Business Review | Implication |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Discipline | Theory-building management (OB / strategy / HRM / marketing / governance) | Macro policy-evaluation framing is off-fit |
| Contribution | Concept / proposition / framework that advances a management theory | "Regression is significant" is not a contribution |
| Hypotheses | Each backed by a theoretical mechanism | "We expect a positive relationship" gets desk-rejected |
| Measurement | Reliability (α, CR) + validity (convergent/discriminant, AVE) + CMV test | Borrowed scales with no psychometrics fail review |
| Method | Survey-SEM / experiment / multi-case — serves the theory | Causal-identification cleanliness is not the bar |
| China context | Context must enter the theory | A China sample is not contextualization |
| Abstract | 100–300 chars, 3–8 keywords, bilingual | Lead with the proposition, not background |

## The Twelve Skills

| Skill | Role |
|-------|------|
| `nbr-workflow` | Router — which skill next; cross-refs sibling journal stacks |
| `nbr-fit-positioning` | On-target? Re-route math models / macro policy elsewhere |
| `nbr-theory-gap` | Articulate the theoretical gap and the contribution |
| `nbr-hypothesis-development` | Every hypothesis backed by a mechanism, not intuition |
| `nbr-measurement` | Reliability (α, CR), validity (AVE), common-method-bias tests |
| `nbr-survey-sem` | SEM / mediation / moderation / moderated mediation / HLM |
| `nbr-experiment` | Manipulation checks, randomization, effect sizes |
| `nbr-qualitative-case` | Multi-case comparison / grounded coding / saturation & trustworthiness |
| `nbr-china-context` | How the China context changes construct relationships |
| `nbr-discussion-contribution` | Discussion that loops back and advances a theory |
| `nbr-submission` | Preflight: format, abstract limits, online system |
| `nbr-rebuttal` | R&R response letter |
