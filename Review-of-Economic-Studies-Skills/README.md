Agent skill stack for manuscripts targeted at **The Review of Economic Studies (REStud)** — one of the "top-5" economics journals, run by The Review of Economic Studies Ltd and published by Oxford University Press.

This repository is opinionated. It is **not** a generic economics writing toolbox. It is a **REStud-specific** stack covering original-contribution topic selection, literature positioning, state-of-the-art causal identification, rigorous theory-model development with online-appendix proofs, demanding robustness, clean exhibits, REStud house style, replication packages, referee strategy, submission preflight, and multi-round R&R rebuttals.

REStud is historically European-rooted and famously **friendly to young scholars** — the annual REStud Tour / "May Meetings" showcases junior economists' job-market-stage work.

## Why a Separate REStud Skill Stack?

REStud sits alongside AER / QJE / JPE / Econometrica but its center of gravity is distinctive:

| Constraint            | Review of Economic Studies                                        | Implication                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scope                 | Theoretical **and** applied economics, all fields                 | Field-agnostic; a clean theory paper is as welcome as applied      |
| Hallmark contribution | A new model, a new identification strategy, or a striking new fact| "Competent application of a known toolkit" is not enough           |
| Bar                   | Originality + technical excellence + elegance                     | The economic payoff must be legible quickly                        |
| Identification        | State-of-the-art causal design **or** rigorous structural ID      | TWFE, weak IV, naive RDD are flagged; assumptions stated explicitly |
| Theory                | Complete, correct proofs in an **online appendix**                | Theory without a clear economic payoff is rejected                 |
| References            | Author-date (Harvard) style                                       | Numbered-reference style is off-house                              |
| Replication           | Data/code required for accepted empirical papers (OUP policy)     | Plan the deposit early; verify current rules                       |
| Refereeing            | Demanding referees; strong papers developed across rounds         | Treat the R&R as collaboration, not a verdict                      |
| Young scholars        | REStud Tour / May Meetings showcase junior work                   | One sharp contribution beats a sprawling paper                     |

Generic "scientific writing" or "economics writing" skill packs do not address these constraints. Volatile specifics (current editors, exact fees, exact word limits) change — this stack tells you the durable norms and sends you to the journal's official page to verify the numbers.

## Quick Start

### Option A — Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/restud-skills
/plugin install restud-skills
/reload-plugins
```

### Option B — Manual Copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/restud-skills.git
cd restud-skills

mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -R skills/restud-* ~/.claude/skills/
# or
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills && cp -R skills/restud-* ~/.codex/skills/
```

### First Prompt

```
Use restud-workflow to tell me which skill I should use next for my REStud manuscript.
```

---

## Default Workflow

```text
restud-topic-selection
        ▼
restud-literature-positioning
        ▼
restud-identification   ──┐  (empirical branch)
        ▼                 │
restud-theory-model     ──┘  (theory branch; both for theory-with-empirics)
        ▼
restud-robustness
        ▼
restud-tables-figures
        ▼
restud-writing-style    (polish)
        ▼
restud-replication-package
        ▼
restud-referee-strategy
        ▼
restud-submission
        ▼
restud-rebuttal
```

`restud-workflow` is the router — it tells you which skill to use next based on where you are. `restud-identification` and `restud-theory-model` are parallel branches.

## Skills

| Skill                         | Purpose                                                            |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `restud-workflow`             | Router — decides which sub-skill to invoke next                    |
| `restud-topic-selection`      | Top-5 bar test + one-sentence original-contribution template       |

| `restud-robustness`           | Referee-anticipating checks; no result hinging on one specification |

| `restud-replication-package`  | Data/code deposit, README, reproducibility audit (verify OUP policy) |
| `restud-referee-strategy`     | Map the referee pool; pre-empt the objections before submission    |
| `restud-submission`           | Pre-submission preflight + manuscript template (anonymity, format) |
| `restud-rebuttal`             | R&R response-letter structure; triage and revise-first discipline  |

## Differences vs. Other Top-5 Stacks

| Dimension          | Review of Economic Studies        | AER                              | Econometrica                    |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Center of gravity  | Original contribution + elegance  | Cross-subfield interest / policy | Formal/methodological depth     |
| Theory             | First-class, payoff must be legible| Welcome with empirical hook     | Heavy machinery is the contribution |
| Young scholars     | Explicitly showcased (May Meetings)| —                               | —                               |
| Reference style    | Author-date                       | Author-date                      | Author-date                     |

If the paper is finance-specific (JF / JFE / RFS) or so abstract it is really a math paper, a different stack fits better.
