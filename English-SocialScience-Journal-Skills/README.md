English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

An opinionated agent skill stack for the **100 mainstream English-language economics / finance / management / accounting / marketing / operations / information-systems journals** on the parent repository's roadmap — every economics "top-5", the finance "top-3", the AOM / SMS management elite, and the FT50 / UTD24 / ABS 4★ venues.

This is the English-language sibling of [`Chinese-SocialScience-Journal-Skills`](../Chinese-SocialScience-Journal-Skills/). Like that bundle, it ships **one self-contained fit-and-house-style skill per journal**, plus `en-journal-workflow` for routing. Each journal skill helps answer: *is my manuscript on-target, how should it be framed, what method and evidence does this venue expect, and what official submission details must be re-checked?*

For the AEA flagship, a full lifecycle pack ships separately as `AER-skills` (the `aer-*` skills). The `american-economic-review` profile here is the quick fit layer that routes into it — exactly as the Chinese `economic-research` profile routes into the deep `Economic-Research-Journal-Skills` pack.

## Coverage

| Group | Count | Scope |
|---|--:|---|
| Economics | 50 | top-5 + AEJ family, JEL/JEP/REStat, the field flagships (econometrics, macro/monetary, labor, public, IO, trade, development, health, urban, enviro, law-and-economics), plus policy/review venues. |
| Finance | 13 | the top-3 (JF/JFE/RFS) plus the elite field journals (banking, intermediation, microstructure, corporate, international, empirical, mathematical finance). |
| Management / Strategy / Organization | 15 | AMJ/AMR/AMA/ASQ/SMJ/OrgSci, JOM, JMS, OS, Human Relations, HRM, JIBS, Research Policy, JBV, ETP. |
| Marketing | 6 | JM, JMR, Marketing Science, JCR, JCP, JAMS. |
| Accounting | 6 | TAR, JAR, JAE, RAST, CAR, AOS. |
| Operations & Information Systems | 10 | Management Science, OR, M&SOM, JOM-ops, POM; MISQ, ISR, JMIS, JAIS, IJOC. |

## Quick Start

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/awesome-journal-skills
/plugin install english-socsci-journal-skills
/reload-plugins
```

Manual copy:

```bash
cp -R skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
# or for Codex
cp -R skills/* ~/.codex/skills/
```

## How to Use

Start with `en-journal-workflow` when the venue is uncertain — it classifies the manuscript by contribution type, method shape, discipline audience, and submission goal, then routes to the matching per-journal skill. If the target is already known, name the journal directly, for example: “Use `journal-of-finance` to assess this asset-pricing paper for JF.”

Every skill returns a fit verdict, method/evidence requirements, desk-reject risks, official-submission checks, and reroute suggestions.

## Source Discipline

Editorial rules change. The bundled [`resources/source-basis.md`](resources/source-basis.md) records the ranking lists and source policy used for this expansion, [`resources/official-source-map.md`](resources/official-source-map.md) gives one official-source starting query per journal, and volatile facts (impact factors, acceptance rates, word limits, fees) are deliberately omitted. Before final submission, always verify the live official author instructions on the publisher's own site or submission system.

> Naming note: the SAGE *Journal of Management* uses the slug `journal-of-management-en` because the plain `journal-of-management` is already used by the Chinese bundle for 《管理学刊》 — mirroring that bundle's own `-cn` disambiguation convention.
