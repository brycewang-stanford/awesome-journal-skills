Agent skill stack for manuscripts targeted at **Science** (AAAS) — the flagship multidisciplinary research journal.

This pack is opinionated. It is **not** a generic "scientific writing" toolbox. It is a **Science-specific** stack that encodes the journal's editorial bar — **broad significance and general interest** — and the concrete conventions that follow from it: the Report vs Research Article split, the one-sentence summary and ≤125-word abstract, display-item budgets, statistics and reproducibility reporting, mandatory data/code/materials deposition, Science numbered-reference style, and a significance-forward cover letter.

## Why a Separate Science Skill Stack?

Science imposes constraints that differ materially from field journals — and from Nature:

| Constraint                | Science                                                       | Implication                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Editorial bar             | Broad significance + general interest across disciplines      | Most papers are **desk-rejected without review** if specialist |
| Formats                   | Report (~2,500 w, ≤4 items) / Research Article (~4,500 w, ≤6) | Wrong format or over length signals inexperience             |
| One-sentence summary      | Required, ≤ ~125 characters, not the title                    | A missing/weak summary hurts at triage                       |
| Abstract                  | ≤ ~125 words, single paragraph, no subheadings, quantified    | Long structured abstracts are off-style                     |
| Methods location          | In **Supplementary Materials** for Reports                    | Methods in the body bloats the main text                    |
| References                | Numbered, in order of appearance, **one continuous list (incl. SM)**, full author lists | Author–date / Nature style must be converted        |
| Data & code               | Deposited with accession/DOI; "on request" not acceptable     | No accession numbers = not submission-ready                 |
| Over-claiming             | A top rejection reason post-review                            | Conclusions must not outrun the evidence                    |

Generic "scientific writing" packs do not encode these venue constraints.

## Quick Start

### Option A — Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/awesome-journal-skills
/plugin install science-skills
/reload-plugins
```

### Option B — Manual Copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/awesome-journal-skills.git
cd awesome-journal-skills/Science-Skills

mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -R skills/sci-* ~/.claude/skills/
# or
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills && cp -R skills/sci-* ~/.codex/skills/
```

### First Prompt

```
Use sci-workflow to tell me which skill I should use next for my manuscript targeted at Science.
```

---

## Default Workflow

```text
sci-fit            (clear the broad-significance bar first)
        ▼
sci-framing        (lock the advance + why-now)
        ▼
sci-writing        (Report vs Research Article; hold length)
        ▼
sci-figures        (display items within budget)
        ▼
sci-statistics     (rigor + reproducibility)
        ▼
sci-data           (data / code / materials availability)
        ▼
sci-abstract       (one-sentence summary + ≤125-word abstract — polish)
        ▼
sci-citation       (Science numbered style — polish)
        ▼
sci-cover-letter   (significance-forward editor pitch)
        ▼
sci-submission     (preflight)
        ▼
sci-rebuttal       (after review)
```

`sci-workflow` is the router — it tells you which skill to use next based on where you are.

## Differences vs. Nature / Science Advances / PNAS

| Dimension          | Science                          | Nature                            | Science Advances / PNAS            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Bar                | Top-1% broad significance        | Top-1% broad significance         | Broad but more accepting           |
| Signature artifact | One-sentence summary             | Summary paragraph                 | PNAS: 120-word significance statement |
| References         | Numbered, order of appearance    | Different numbered convention     | Own styles                          |
| Methods            | Supplementary (Reports)          | Methods section conventions       | Varies                              |
| When to switch     | —                                | Re-style before transfer          | If not top-1% general interest      |
